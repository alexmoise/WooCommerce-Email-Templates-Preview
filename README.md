# WooCommerce-Email-Templates-Preview
You probably seen it before... Team of developers working on WooCommerce implementation, crunching late-night hours with thousands of lines of code (and complicated talks with designers). They think about all of the complex payment systems and 3rd party integrations, only to forget about one simple little detail - EMAILS.

Yes, emails are easily overlooked, but very important part of your eCommerce system. Think about it. They are the first vessel of communication that your users receive when order is in place. They are on front lines of attack when you issue refunds or send away shipping confirmations. Yet, there was no easy way to test whole scope of emails that are being sent by WooCommerce system. 

To help our coding friends in need, we developed a helper plugin to test all of the possible emails that are being sent by WooCommerce platform. You can see the emails in two main ways:

 - By previewing them directly in the browser (for fast viewing)
 - By sending them to your inbox (now, this is some real testing!)

If youâ€™re wondering what data is populated into these emails for test, be at rest, you can choose what orders will be used for testing purposes and in that way, inspect if big orders have a problem with email templates.

Plugin is currently in beta phase so please download it, try it out and send us your feedback! We will gladly take all comments into account and further bolster the Woo ecosystem.

Happy Coding!
